# Project 2 – Air Pollution Exposure Processing (BIOS 721)

This repository contains code and data for Project 2, focusing on cleaning and summarizing air pollution measurements (CO, PM2.5, O3) from 2018–2020 at the RDU airport monitor.

## Contents

- `midproject2_shan.Rmd`: R Markdown report that reads the raw EPA CSV files, processes the data, and produces the required plots.
- `AQ_2018.csv`, `AQ_2019.csv`, `AQ_2020.csv`: Daily air quality measurements for 2018–2020.
- `midproject2_shan.docx`: Knit Word report that hides codes

## How to run

1. Open `midproject2_shan.Rproj` in RStudio.
2. Knit `midproject2_shan.Rmd` to a Word document (`.docx`).
3. The Word document contains the final report with plots and interpretation.

## Plots
1. Monthly Average CO and O3 Concentrations over 3 Years
2. Monthly Average PM2.5 by Year
